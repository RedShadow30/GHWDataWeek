Global Hack Week - Interactive Maps Visualization

The main goal of this project was for me to learn how to create interactive maps for a web application. I followed along with Major League Hacking GHW Instructor Mr. Utkarsh Tiwari (link to his Github provided at 
the end of README).

This web application utilizes a cartographic map of the world to visualize four topics geographically. The first tab, "GLOBAL COMPANIES MAP", is a map of the top 50 global companies and their geographic location. 
The geographic location is not each company's exact location, rather it is placed approximately at the center. The location moves as the viwer zooms in or clicks on it. The second tab, "AA FLIGHT PATHS", visualizes 
the various flight paths that are taken by American Airlines in the United States of America. It is not in real-time. The third tab, "STATE-MAP SCATTER MAP", generates an interactive map with the capitals of each
state in India. Each capital is colored uniquely and provides the latitude and longitude information once cursor hovers over the capital. The final tab, "STATE-CITY CHOROPLETH MAP", generates a map of India with
each state as a different color. Once cursor hovers over a state, the state and capital city is displayed.

This web application used Replit for efficiently writing/testing the code and Streamlit to deploy the web application. A challenge I faced was when attempting to add a more desirable flight icon. Some images online
did not have the flight icon alone but also the background. I will continue to investigate on how I could add solely the flight icon that is more personalized. 

This project is still a WORK IN PROGRESS where the main changes will be made to the "AA FLIGHT PATHS" portion of this project. 
The goal is to have randomly generated color for each flight path and have the flights move along the line if the cursor hovers over that specific flight path. As mentioned previously, the flight icon will be updated.
